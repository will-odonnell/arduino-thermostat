arduino-thermostat
==================

Arduino project for a thermostat that monitors individual room temperatures and adjusts airflow.

This was a term project for VLSI communications.  The final version should be able to control an HVAC system and change the airflow to rooms by contolling the registers in each room.  A room monitor would measure temperatur and transmit the data back to the main unit so it can be more efficient with air distribution.
